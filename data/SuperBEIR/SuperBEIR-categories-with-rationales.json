It serves as a resource for developers seeking to troubleshoot and enhance their WordPress sites.",
        "rationale": "Category Name: cqadupstack-wordpress\n\nCategory Examples: [1] When adding a link in the TinyMCE editor, you get a nice search with ajax function that searches your existing content and lets you select from it. Is it possible/reasonable to re-use this in a plugin? If so, how would I go about doing it? (I'm working on a Related Posts functionality, and while I can easily list ALL posts in the list, it seems it would get out of hand quickly without the ability to search/filter.) [2] I have made a page where you people can find al the teasers (teaser made with the read more tag) from my posts.( By clicking one of them you \"open\" the whole article, including photo's, ... . This is working well. On my homepage I want a short welcome text and in a sidebar my 3 recent posts. I'm first trying to get the recent posts on my homepage with following code <?php function recentPosts() { $rPosts = new WP_Query(); $rPosts->query('showposts=3'); while ($rPosts->have_posts()) : $rPosts->the_post(); ?> <a href=\"<?php the_permalink();?>\"><?php the_post_thumbnail('recent-thumbnails'); ?></a> <h2><a href=\"<?php the_permalink(); ?>\"><?php the_title();?></a></h2> <?php the_content(); ?> <?php endwhile; wp_reset_query(); } ?> This is working well but on my homepage I'm getting all the content from my articles and I only want a teaser. (2 lines for example). I don't know how to do this here. Below you see the code of the home page. <?php /** * @content not visible * @content not visible * * Template Name: homepage */ ?> <?php get_header(); ?> <?php echo recentPosts(); ?> <?php the_content(); ?> <?php get_footer(); ?> [3] I'm occasionally facing this problem and not sure what causes it, any ideas? <?php get_header(); ?> <div class=\"content\" role=\"main\"> <h1><?php the_title(); ?></h1> <?php get_template_part( 'loop', 'index' ); ?> </div> <?php get_footer(); ?> [4] I want to set also text comment as required... but in the backend only email and author are possible. Without using a javascript validation, how it is possible? Thank you [5] Is there any free starter theme to make mobile websites using WordPress? [6] I have a hierarchical taxonomy called 'tarefa' I have to display all posts from a child taxonomy. I used get_term_children function function to verify if the taxonomy parent has children. If the taxonomy parent has children I will query posts by taxonomy children. The problem is: I have to query posts by taxonomy slug but the function get_term_children return an array of taxonomy IDS. The question is: How can I return a taxonomy slug by a taxonomy ID? [7] The documentation for dealing with official WP repository is exclusively about using command line. While I have no bias against that, I do have little experience with VCS and two (or three) different ones I will have to figure out and use in nearest future. So for now I wing it with VCS integration features in IDEs (NetBeans, PHPStorm). Which often leaves me confused on specifics and ways of doing things properly. Are there any good articles/posts/guides on using official SVN repository (or at least SVN in general) with IDEs or other GUI-based tools? Something that focuses on concepts and workflow, rather than typing in arcane lines in console. [8] Is there a way to rotate widgets or text blocks with a Flash banner? I had a widget loading a Flash Video loaded by wordTube Flash and YouTube player. The client wanted to rotate this video together with some Flash text (effect showing text being typed). I replaced the Flash text banner by the jQuery Tickertype plugin - better SEO - and I tried Datafeedr to load both alternatively. It allows you to add html and Flash into severa ads per adgroup. But I realized that plugin only rotates ads on page refresh. Any plugin that rotates (ad) blocks every x seconds or minutes? **Update 1** I am testing http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/randomtext/ , but it does not seem to rotate even though I do not have a caching plugin running. **Update 2** jQuery on jQuery howto Blog seemed promising, but it grabs content from a file and not let's say content from a different HTML element. **Update 3** Checking http://forums.asp.net/t/1777232.aspx/1?Fade+In+Out+between+two+divs for jQuery `animate()` with 'setTimeout`and`fadeIn()`and`fadeOut()` All rather new to me and wondering if I can combine this Tickertype. **Update 4** I have added some jQuery to rotate two divs, but I cannot seem to be able to keep the text widget I use to rotate these two divs of a fixed size. Here is the basic plugin: $(document).ready(function () { fadeIn_(); }) function fadeIn_() { $('#flash').fadeIn(2000, function () { setTimeout(\"$('#flash').fadeOut(2500); fadeOut_();\", 6000); }) } function fadeOut_() { $('#ticker-area').fadeIn(2000, function () { setTimeout(\"$('#ticker-area').fadeOut(2500); fadeIn_();\", 6000); }) } And this is the HTML and CSS inside the text widget: <div id=\"flash-rotate\"><div id=\"flash\"><object width=\"560\" height=\"315\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" id=\"WT1\" name=\"WT1\" data=\"http://elc.imagewize.com/wp-content/uploads/player.swf\"><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"><param name=\"allownetworking\" value=\"all\"><param name=\"flashvars\" value=\"file=path/to/file.flv&volume=80&bufferlength=5&quality=false&logo.hide=false&image=http%3A%2F%2Fdomain.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2012%2F02%2Fsteve-martin-thumb.png&title=Steve%20Martin%20learning%20English&linktarget=_self\"></object> </div> <div id=\"ticker-area\"> <ul> <li>Sed venenatis <a href=\"http://www.google.com\">diam quis</a> lorem. Curabitur.</li> <li>Fusce <strong>vehicula</strong> iaculis felis. Phasellus congue!</li> <li>Morbi vitae enim vel <em>purus sollicitudin</em>.</li> </ul> </div> </div> CSS: #home-top-row .widget_text {margin-top: 50px;} #ticker-area{ width:320px; height:240px; padding: 10px 0; margin: 20px 0; font-size: 1.5em; font-weight: normal; color: #060; } /*Flash and TickerType*/ #flash-rotate, #text-5{ width:320px; height:240px; } **Update 5** Tinkered with CSS background and dimensions and now all good! [9] Imagine i have a URL structure like this: www.domain.com/category/subcategory/ This is my code: <?php $args=array( 'child_of' => $cat-id, 'hide_empty' => 0, 'orderby' => 'name', 'order' => 'ASC' ); $categories=get_categories($args); foreach($categories as $category) { echo '<a href=\"' . get_category_link( $category->term_id ) . '\" title=\"' . sprintf( __( \"View all posts in %s\" ), $category->name ) . '\" ' . '>' . $category->name.'</a>'; } ?> When I'm on \"www.domain.com/category/\" the code correctly displays all children of the category, but when on \"www.domain.com/category/subcategory/\" the code doesn't display any results because the subcategory doesnt have any children. I need the code to only display the children of the top-level category even when on it's child pages. How do i accomplish this? TIA. [10] I've created a custom post type and on the admin page for that post type I want an image displayed that can act as a guide for the users uploading images. Is there a function that I can use to insert an image into the admin for just that custom post type. (I have tried to Google this but all the results seem to be related to uploading images).\n\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to summarize the category description.
